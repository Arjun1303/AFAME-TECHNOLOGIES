Titanic Survival Prediction Project
Project Overview
The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone on board, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.

This project uses the Titanic dataset to build a model that predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not. This is a classic beginner project with readily available data that contains information about individual passengers, such as their age, gender, ticket class, fare, cabin, and whether or not they survived.

Objectives
Data Preprocessing:

Load and inspect the dataset.
Handle missing values.
Encode categorical variables.
Normalize and scale numerical features.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Analyze the distribution of key features.
Visualize relationships between features and survival rates.
Model Building:

Split the data into training and test sets.
Train various machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest).
Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).
Model Selection and Tuning:

Select the best-performing model.
Tune hyperparameters for improved performance.
Perform cross-validation to ensure model robustness.
Project Steps
Data Loading and Preprocessing:

Load the Titanic dataset.
Handle missing values (e.g., imputation).
Encode categorical features (e.g., gender, embarked).
Scale numerical features (e.g., age, fare).
Exploratory Data Analysis:

Visualize the distribution of passenger demographics.
Explore the relationship between passenger features and survival.
Identify key features that influence survival rates.
Model Training:
